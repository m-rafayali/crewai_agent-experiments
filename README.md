# CrewAI Agent Lab

CrewAI Agent Lab is a curated collection of experimental multi-agent systems built with **CrewAI** for learning, prototyping, and automation. Each subfolder represents a specialized agent crew with defined roles, workflows, and objectives.

## Projects

| Folder                   | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **coder**                | Agents that collaborate to write, debug, and explain code in various programming languages.                |
| **debate**               | A team of agents that debate opposing sides of a topic and reach informed conclusions.                     |
| **engineering_team**     | Simulates a collaborative software engineering team with roles such as project manager, developer, and QA. |
| **financial_researcher** | Performs market research, financial analysis, and company profiling using web tools and LLMs.              |
| **stock_picker**         | Analyzes market trends, filters stock data, and provides buy/sell recommendations.                         |

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* CrewAI

## Use Cases

* Explore CrewAIâ€™s capabilities for inter-agent collaboration
* Prototype intelligent multi-role agents for research and enterprise automation
* Extend workflows with tools like **SerpAPI**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI functions**

## Notes

These projects are experimental and designed for learning. They are modular, adaptable, and can be extended or integrated into production-level systems for advanced agentic research and automation.
